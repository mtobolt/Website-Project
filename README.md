# Website-Project
Website final project for my Web Development class. Built with Bootstrap framework

These are some of the code for the final website project I completed for my Web Development class. It was designed based on a local
photographer who needed a new website to post her gallaries. 

The .html files are the different pages you can access on the website and index.html is the front page.
